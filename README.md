# Android‑IDS

An **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** for Android that monitors device behavior and network traffic using machine learning to detect and alert on anomalous or potentially malicious activities in real time.

---

##  Features

- **Real‑Time Monitoring**  
  Monitors device-level behaviors (e.g. app activities, system events) and network traffic to detect anomalies.

- **Machine Learning‑Based Detection**  
  Employs ML algorithms (e.g. Isolation Forest, Random Forest, Neural Networks) to identify unusual patterns or malicious behavior.

- **Alert & Notification System**  
  Generates alerts or logs when suspicious behavior is detected, with options for in-app notifications or external reporting.

- **Modular, Extensible Design**  
  Structure supports easy extension—add new detection models, data sources, or alerting methods.

##  Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run Android‑IDS on your local device or emulator for development and testing.

---

##  How It Works

### 1. Data Collection  
Monitors device behavior (apps opened/foreground events, system logs, etc.) and captures network traffic (e.g., packet headers, destinations, volumes).

### 2. Feature Extraction  
Transforms raw data into meaningful features—like network statistics, frequency of app launches, system calls counts, etc.—suitable for ML analysis.

### 3. Model & Detection  
Loads a trained machine learning model to assess data in real time. Depending on configuration, detects anomalies via thresholds or statistical measures (e.g., anomaly scores) and flags suspicious behavior.

### 4. Alerting  
Logs alerts locally or pushes notifications. Could integrate with remote reporting services or dashboards as needed.

---

##  Installation

### Prerequisites  
- Android Studio (latest version recommended)  
- Android SDK with required API levels  
- Kotlin/Java (as per project's implementation)  
- ML model file (e.g., `.tflite`, `.joblib`, `.pkl`)

### Setup Steps  
1. Clone the repository:  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sabyasachi1889/Android-IDS.git
    cd Android-IDS
    ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio and ensure all dependencies download successfully.

3. Place the trained model (default path) in `app/src/main/assets/model/` or another designated folder.

4. Build and run the app on a device or emulator.

---

##  Usage

1. Launch the app. IDS should begin monitoring automatically (or via manual activation).

2. Navigate to the **Monitoring** screen to view real-time stats.

3. Check the **Alerts** section when suspicious activity is flagged.

4. For development: simulate anomalous behavior to test detection (e.g., abnormal network traffic or launching suspicious app workflows).

---

##  Configuration

Modify detection behavior via configuration (e.g., in `config.json`, `settings.xml`, or code):

| Key                | Description                                 | Default Value |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `threshold_score`  | Anomaly threshold value for alerts           | `0.65`        |
| `monitor_interval` | Interval (ms) between checks                 | `1000`        |
| `logging_enabled`  | Flag to enable verbose log output            | `false`       |
| `alert_channels`   | Options: [Toast, Notification, Log, Remote]  | `[Toast, Log]`|

- Inspiration: standard IDS frameworks combining **signature-based** and **anomaly-based** detection methods. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Similar open‑source IDS implementations across network and host-based systems that employ **ML models** for anomaly detection (e.g., Isolation Forest, LSTM, Random Forest) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

##  Final Notes

This template gives a solid foundation. To enhance it:

- Add examples of detected alerts (e.g., screenshots or logs).
- Include model training/preparation scripts under a `models/` directory.
- Offer performance metrics (false-positive rate, detection accuracy).
- Integrate unit-test coverage and CI workflows.

Let me know if you’d like help fleshing out any of these sections or tailoring it specifically to your project files!
